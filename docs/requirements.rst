The Problem
-----------

If one of the many fridges or freezers goes out in this food pantry, it could be a potential loss of thousands of pounds of food.

The Current Solution
--------------------

The runner of the pantry has a thermometer and he has to go around to all of the appliances to check their temperature.
Very inefficient and it's a very tedious process.

Required Solution
-----------------

The solution is to have a system of devices that can instantly alert them if one of the appliances is too cold or too hot.

Refrigeration
-------------

* A total of 11 fridges and freezers
* Spread across 4 rooms
